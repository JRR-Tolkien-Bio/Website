                Long before becoming the iconic author of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, J.R.R. Tolkien was a
                passionate student with a love for languages and ancient myths. He studied at Exeter College, University
                of Oxford, where he initially pursued Classics before switching to English Language and Literature,
                graduating with first-class honors in 1915.

                During his youth, Tolkien found a kindred circle of friends in a group known as The Tea Club, Barrovian
                Society (TCBS). Formed in 1911 during his school days at King Edward's School in Birmingham, the group
                included Geoffrey Bache Smith, Robert Quilter Gilson, and Christopher Wiseman. The TCBS would gather to
                drink tea (sometimes illicitly) in Barrow’s Stores and discuss literature, life, and dreams of creating
                great art. Their friendship and intellectual exchanges left a lasting impression on Tolkien, inspiring
                much of his later work and the creation of Middle-earth’s rich mythology.

                Tragically, the horrors of World War I claimed the lives of Smith and Gilson, both of whom died in
                battle in 1916, but their memory and ideals lived on through Tolkien’s writings. The impact of their
                friendship and the intellectual bond they shared is reflected in the stories Tolkien would go on to
                write, which continue to captivate readers today. A testament to how even the greatest epics can be born
                from simple beginnings — a cup of tea, deep friendship, and shared passion for storytelling.
