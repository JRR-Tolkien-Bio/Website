                After serving in World War I, J.R.R. Tolkien shifted his focus to the myths, histories, and languages he
                had been crafting, eventually naming this body of work the Legendarium. In 1924, he became a professor
                at Leeds University, where he furthered his studies in philology and medieval literature.

                In 1936, Tolkien gave his renowned lecture, “Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics”, which significantly
                influenced modern understanding of the epic poem. Around the same time, he began writing The Hobbit,
                famously beginning the story with the sentence, “In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.”

                By 1945, Tolkien was a professor at Merton College, Oxford, where he taught English Language and
                Literature until his retirement in 1959. During his time at Oxford, he became part of a literary group
                known as The Inklings, which included notable figures like C.S. Lewis, the author of The Chronicles of
                Narnia. Together, they shared and critiqued each other’s work, fostering a creative environment that
                shaped some of the greatest literary works of the 20th century.
