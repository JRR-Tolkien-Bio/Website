                Tolkien’s experiences during World War I profoundly shaped his imagination and storytelling. In 1915,
                after completing his degree at Exeter College, University of Oxford, Tolkien joined the British Army as
                a second lieutenant in the Lancashire Fusiliers. That same year, he was sent to France to fight in the
                infamous Battle of the Somme, one of the deadliest battles in history, which began on July 1, 1916.
                There, he witnessed the horrors of trench warfare, immense loss, and devastation.

                The war also shattered the TBCS. In 1916, Smith and Gilson were killed in action — Smith on December 3,
                1916, and Gilson on July 2, 1916. This loss left Tolkien deeply grieved, and only Wiseman, the fourth
                member of their inner circle, survived.

                The loss of his friends and the darkness of war left an indelible mark on Tolkien’s soul. The themes of
                friendship, sacrifice, and the relentless struggle between good and evil that define The Lord of the
                Rings owe much to these experiences and the memories of the comradeship he shared with the TCBS. It was
                in the wake of these painful events, in 1917, that Tolkien began his career as a philologist and started
                to develop the languages and stories that would eventually lead to the creation of Middle-earth.
