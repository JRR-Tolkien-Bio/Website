                After decades of marriage, J.R.R. Tolkein and Edith Tolkien's love story came to its earthly end with
                their passing, only two years apart.

                Edith Tolkien passed away on November 29, 1971, at the age of 82. Her death was a profound loss for
                Tolkien, who had relied on her companionship and support throughout their 55 years of marriage.
                Devastated but determined to honor her, Tolkien arranged for the name "Lúthien" to be engraved beneath
                hers on their shared gravestone in Wolvercote Cemetery, Oxford.

                Tolkien himself passed away less than two years later, on September 2, 1973, at the age of 81. He had
                lived long enough to see his works achieve immense popularity, but his final years were marked by
                declining health and the grief of losing Edith. After his death, the name "Beren" was inscribed beneath
                his, completing the tribute to their legendary love story.

                Together in life and in death, Tolkien and Edith’s bond became a testament to the power of love and
                devotion—a theme that echoes throughout Tolkien’s tales and continues to inspire readers around the
                world.
