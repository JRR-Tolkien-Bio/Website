                Tolkien's marriage and family life were crucial in shaping his personal happiness and creative legacy.
                In 1908, as a teenager, Tolkien met Edith Bratt, a fellow orphan who lived in the same boarding house.
                The two quickly formed a deep connection, but their relationship faced obstacles. Father Francis Morgan
                disapproved their romance, fearing it would distract Tolkien from his academic aspirations. Out of
                respect for Father Morgan, Tolkien agreed to cease contact with Edith until he turned 21.

                On the evening of his 21st birthday in January 1913, Tolkien wrote to Edith, professing his enduring
                love and asking her to marry him. By then, Edith had become engaged to another man, but Tolkien’s letter
                rekindled her feelings. She broke off her engagement, and the two were reunited. They married on March
                22, 1916, in a Catholic ceremony, marking the beginning of a lifelong partnership that profoundly
                influenced Tolkien’s work.

                Edith became Tolkien's muse and was the inspiration for the tale of Beren and Lúthien, one of the
                central stories of his Middle-earth legendarium. Their love story—one of overcoming adversity and
                defying the odds—resonates deeply within the myths of Middle-earth. Tolkien even had the names "Beren"
                and "Lúthien" inscribed on their shared gravestone after Edith's death.

                They had four children: John (1917), Michael (1920), Christopher (1924), and Priscilla (1929). Tolkien
                was a devoted father who enjoyed entertaining his children with stories and imaginative tales. Many of
                these stories, including The Hobbit, began as bedtime narratives for them. His family often played an
                active role in his creative process; Christopher, in particular, would later become a vital editor and
                curator of his father’s unpublished works, ensuring the enduring legacy of Middle-earth.

                Tolkien’s letters to his children reveal a tender, humorous, and affectionate father who cherished his
                family life despite the demands of his academic and literary career. His deep love for Edith and their
                kids not only provided him with a stable foundation but also inspired the themes of love, sacrifice, and
                the bonds of family that permeate his works.
